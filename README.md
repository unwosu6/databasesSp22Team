No shifts in topic direction was made and no additional data was included as compared to Phase C. We’ve not discussed anything during those phase with our mentor. 

There were changes to the topic direction in regards to the questions from Phase A. Initially we had many questions about mental health and level of depression, but have since consolidated those two ideas into "life satisfaction."

One possible change that might be made in the future is to make a “both” category for sex in AnnualDemoStats and WorksIn, as just having male/female has caused a little difficulty during part one, but we’ve overcome that difficulty. If this becomes a bigger issue as we continue to Phase E, we will make the changes then.
