Modifications
Since phase A, no major changes were made to the domain. We did shift away some focus on depression/mental health and focused most of our attention on "life satisfaction" as our main metric. As a result, we replaced a lot of the questions with life satisfaction.  We also found a lot of annual data, so many of our questions included a year option. Though a lot of the questiosn got replaced, their structure and focus stayed mostly the same. 

Process
None of the process was adjusted from Phase C

Successes
1. We really like the implementation of the dynamic dropdowns in the menu, which collects the options from the database. 
2. Many of our queries were made far more broader than their original scope, by allowing the user to select exactly what factors they want the question to be about. Questions that initially only compared populations and fertility rate acorss continents/years, for example, can compare a lot more factors now. This was also aided by the dynamic dropdowns above.
3. The initial data processing took a while and there were some weird things going on with the formating of the source. 

Known Issues
There are a lot of countries with no data (set as null). This doesn't cause any errors, but it does result in a lot of messages about not having data. 

Extensions
1. Find more data, to address the issue mentioned above. 
2. Have a way to update the options for the query, so that when an option is selected from a dropdown, options for the other blanks get updated and restricted to only available options. 
3. Make an interactive visual of the world map that you can click/roll over to see the results
