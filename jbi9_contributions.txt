For phases A-B, we met up in person and online to complete the work. Most of the work was collaborative, where we worked together at the same time. 

For phase C-E we did it mostly online, but we zoom called before to discuss any changes and plan out the work, and then called again afterwards to work through any issues.

Phase C we split up the data files to process separately, but then ended up sending passing the files around to the other person depending on what needed to be done. 
That's why the files were processed by both python and R, because we had different preferences and the languages were suited for different things. 
We split up the setups for the relations, Udochukwu wrote the cleanup script, and I did the README. We filled out the process.txt for our respective parts. 

Phase D we split up the queries by evens and odds. Udochukwu did the insertions/deletions and I did the README. 

Phase E we split up the queries, once we went through and discussed what visualizations can be done, and figured out which ones were good for combining. 
Udochukwu then did most of the rest of the coding.  I only did a full error check and the rest of the deliverables. 

Above and beyond:
Udochukwu really went all out during phase E, and completed what a majority of the coding on her own.
